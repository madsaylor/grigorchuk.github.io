      <description>Modern laptops are unusable. Spending more than a couple of hours on a laptop leads to neck or back pain. At first, it&amp;rsquo;s just not comfortable, but then it becomes unbearable. The laptop forces you to hunch over it.
  You are digital nomad, congrats
  Your neck, wrists, and back will eventually be hurt. For me, it was the neck. I just have to come up with something or I couldn&amp;rsquo;t work.</description>

      <description>When it comes to watermelons, you never know. How to tell if product is good without trying it? Let&amp;rsquo;s say you want to buy a pizza. You can accidentally see some ads on tv or, more likely, social media. I donâ€™t know about you, but for me ads add zero or even negative credibility to products. Ads help to get known, but can it convince you about quality? I doubt it.</description>

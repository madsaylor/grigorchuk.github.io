      <description>Congrats! You are a digital nomad!
  Modern laptops are unusable. Spending more than a couple of hours on a laptop leads to neck or back pain. At first, it’s just uncomfortable, but then it becomes unbearable. The laptop forces you to hunch over it while you’re supposed to be sitting straight.
Your neck, wrists or back will eventually be hurt. For me, it was the neck. I just had to come up with something, or I couldn’t work.</description>

      <description>When it comes to watermelons, you never know. How to tell if a product is good without trying it? Let&amp;rsquo;s say you want to buy a pizza. You can accidentally see some ads on tv or, more likely, social media. I don’t know about you, but for me ads add zero or even negative credibility to products. Ads help to get known, but can it convince you about quality? I doubt it.</description>
